     * URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. 
     * You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold 
     * the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the 
     * string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so 
     * that you can perform this operation in place.) EXAMPLE Input: "Mr John Smith ", 
     * 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith" 
     * 
     * String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression 
     * using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa 
     * would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller 
     * than the original string, your method should return the original string. You 
     * can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a -z). 
     * 
     * Given two strings a and b, find whether any anagram of string a is a sub-string 
     * of string b. For eg: if a = xyz and b = afdgzyxksldfm then the program 
     * should return true.
     * a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, 
     * formed from iceman.
     * 
     * Code a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and 
     * returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, 
     * but every word is inverted. 
     * Example, for this input string
     * @"the boy ran" => @"eht yob nar"
